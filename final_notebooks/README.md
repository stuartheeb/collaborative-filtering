# CIL 2022 Project Repository

Team: Runtime Terror

## Running the code

The notebooks can be run on Google Colab. For the case of Knowledge Graphs, it is best if the code is run locally due to RAM requirements.

## Content

The project contains the following methods, runnable as self-contained and independent Jupyter notebooks, for collaborative filtering. [This](Bayesian_Factorization_Machines/Ordered_Probit/Bayesian_SVDpp_flipped_with_Embeddings_Ordered_Probit.ipynb) is the notebook that produced the best score. One must run all the cells of this particular notebook to generate the predictions.

## Data Preprocessing

For data input processing and preparation, we used some code found in the notebook for the CIL 2021 course, available [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dalab/lecture_cil_public/blob/master/exercises/2021/Project_1.ipynb).
