# CIL 2022 Project Repository

Team: Runtime Terror

## Running the codes

The notebooks can be run on Google Colab. For the case of X, it is best if the code is run locally due to RAM requirements.

## Content

The project contains the following methods, runnable as self-contained and independent Jupyter notebooks, for collaborative filtering:

### Matrix Factorization

* The baseline solution - SVD + ALS on a normalized dataset ([notebook](final notebooks/Baseline.ipynb)).
* ...

### Neural Networks

* Neural Net for Collaborative Filtering ([notebook](final notebooks/neural_net.ipynb)).
* Sparse FC ([notebook](final notebooks/sparceFC.ipynb)).
* Knowledge Graphs ([notebook](final notebooks/Knowledge Graphs.ipynb)).

### Factorization Machines

* ...
